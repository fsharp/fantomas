# FAQ

## Why the name "Fantomas"?

There are a few reasons to choose the name as such.
First, it starts with an "F" just like many other F# projects.
Second, Fantomas is my favourite character in the literature.
Finally, Fantomas has the same Greek root as "[phantom](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phantom)"; coincidentally F# ASTs and formatting rules are so *mysterious* to be handled correctly.

## Why do I need prerelease?

Fantomas is both a tool and a library. Before Fantomas v5, the tool was called `fantomas-tool` and the library `Fantomas`.  
After some user feedback, we decided to rename `Fantomas` (the library) to `Fantomas.Core` and `fantomas-tool` to `fantomas`.

Once v5 is released, users will be able to install the tool using `dotnet tool install fantomas`.  
Because there is no stable release yet, `NuGet` will not resolve `fantomas` as a tool but as a regular library.
Thus, for the time being, you need to add `--prerelease` to resolve this.

At the time of writing we are in `beta` and consider **version five** to be **production ready**.

## Why exit code 99 for a failed format check?

No real reason, it was [suggested](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas/pull/655#discussion_r374849907) by the contributor [lpedrosa](https://github.com/lpedrosa).  
It also reminds us of a certain Jay-Z song ðŸ˜‰.

## Can I make a style suggestion?

As mention in [style guide](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/docs/end-users/StyleGuide.html), Fantomas adheres to [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/style-guide/formatting) and [G-Research](https://github.com/G-Research/fsharp-formatting-conventions) style guidelines.  
For any style related suggestion, please head over to [fsharp/fslang-design](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design#style-guide).  
[More context](https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/docs/end-users/StyleGuide.html#Default-style-guide).

## Is it safe to use the Alpha version of Fantomas?

Preview alpha versions are generally safe to use but there is no guarantee that the style wouldn't change due to ongoing development.  
You should check the [changelog](https://github.com/fsprojects/fantomas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see if there's any relevant change to try out in the Alpha.
